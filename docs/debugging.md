# Debugging Log

## Problem
The browser extension overlay, popup, and options page each handled settings too locally. The overlay toggle, close action, theme switch, auto-selected text behavior, and keyboard shortcut were not all backed by the same persisted settings source.

## Suspected Cause
Settings were being read once on mount and then mutated in isolated UI state. The overlay did not subscribe to storage updates, and the shortcut command was not wired to any storage mutation.

## Files Touched
- `extension/src/lib/chrome-storage.ts`
- `extension/src/background/service-worker.ts`
- `extension/manifest.json`
- `extension/src/styles/globals.css`
- `extension/src/components/Button.tsx`
- `extension/src/components/GlassPanel.tsx`
- `extension/src/components/TextInput.tsx`
- `extension/src/components/Toggle.tsx`
- `extension/src/options/OptionsApp.tsx`
- `extension/src/popup/PopupApp.tsx`
- `extension/src/content/OverlayApp.tsx`

## Fix Attempted
- Added settings normalization plus a storage subscription helper.
- Added a shared update helper for partial settings writes.
- Registered a Chrome command that toggles `overlayEnabled` in storage.
- Refactored popup, options, and overlay UI to read the persisted settings snapshot and react to storage changes.
- Added light/dark theme support through CSS variables and theme-aware UI components.
- Made the overlay close button persistently disable the overlay instead of only collapsing local UI state.

## Final Result
- `npm run typecheck` passed in `extension/`.
- `npm run build` passed in `extension/`.
- The overlay now follows the persisted settings state, and the shortcut command toggles the overlay through the same storage source of truth.

## Follow-up
- Chrome rejected the manifest when `suggested_key.mac` used `Command`. The manifest now uses `Ctrl+Shift+P` for macOS too, which Chrome maps to Command on Mac.

## New Issue
- The page console reported `Uncaught (in promise) Error: Extension context invalidated` from the content script on `link.springer.com`.

## New Cause
- The overlay startup path was not defensively handling extension lifecycle invalidation during async settings loading, so a rejected promise could bubble into the page console.

## New Fix
- Added a narrow `unhandledrejection` guard in the content script for the known invalidation message.
- Hardened overlay settings initialization with explicit `catch` handling so startup failures do not surface as uncaught promises.

## New Issue
- Floating bubble logo did not render on page overlays while popup/options branding loaded.
- Next dev showed repeated `Fast Refresh had to perform a full reload due to a runtime error`.

## New Cause
- Content scripts load image assets through page-accessible extension URLs, which need explicit `web_accessible_resources` declarations.
- The dev server warning can persist when local build artifacts are stale after major runtime/layout edits.

## New Fix
- Added `web_accessible_resources` for `icons/openPinnaLogo.png` in the extension manifest.
- Added a graceful fallback in the overlay bubble (`op`) when the logo cannot load.
- Cleared `.next` cache directory before restarting dev.
